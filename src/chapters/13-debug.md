# Debug
The same solution for LSP is exist for debugging, its called `DAP`, Debug Adapater Protocol. \
To integrate it you need to install [nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap).

As any good nvim plugin [nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) is a framework and there is plugins that extends it.

Extensions:
* [nvim-dap-ui](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-dap-ui) a interactive ui for debugging, its a must!.
* [dap-buddy.nvim](https://github.com/Pocco81/dap-buddy.nvim) installs DAP servers, you can skip this if you prefer to install the servers manually.
* [persistent-breakpoints.nvim](https://github.com/Weissle/persistent-breakpoints.nvim) saves the breakpoints across nvim restarts
* [goto-breakpoints.nvim](https://github.com/ofirgall/goto-breakpoints.nvim) pair binds to cycle through breakpoints, plugin by me :)
